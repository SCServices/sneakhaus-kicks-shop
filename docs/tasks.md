# Mobile Optimization Bug Fixes

## Bug 1: Shipping Address Missing on Order Confirmation ✅
**Current Behavior:** Order confirmation page displays "United States" only instead of complete shipping address
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Add items to cart and proceed to checkout
2. Fill in complete shipping information (name, address, city, state, zip)
3. Complete payment and go to order confirmation
4. Observe that only country appears, missing all other shipping details

**Expected Behavior:** Order confirmation should display complete shipping address including name, street address, city, state, and zip code

**Root Cause:** Investigation needed - order creation appears to store shipping info correctly, but display may have issue
**Fix Status:** COMPLETED - Verified order confirmation properly displays shipping address from order.shippingInfo

## Bug 2: Accessories Display Causes Horizontal Scroll on Mobile ✅
**Current Behavior:** Upsell modal accessories display side-by-side causing horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Add items to cart and proceed to checkout
2. Select accessories in upsell modal on mobile device
3. Observe horizontal scrolling required to see full accessory information
4. Layout breaks on screens under 640px width

**Expected Behavior:** Accessories should stack vertically on mobile with no horizontal scrolling required
**Fix Plan:**
- Convert accessory layout from horizontal flex to responsive stacking
- Use flex-col on mobile, flex-row on desktop (sm:flex-row)
- Separate product info display for mobile vs desktop
- Ensure quantity controls don't force horizontal overflow

**Fix Status:** COMPLETED - Implemented responsive layout that stacks vertically on mobile

## Bug 3: Payment Form Fields Too Wide on Mobile ✅
**Current Behavior:** Payment form uses 2-column grid causing cramped layout and CVV field unnecessarily wide on mobile
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to checkout payment step on mobile device
2. Observe card number, expiry, and CVV fields in cramped 2-column layout
3. CVV field takes up half the width despite only needing 3-4 characters
4. Form appears cluttered and difficult to use on mobile

**Expected Behavior:** 
- Single column layout on mobile devices
- CVV field should be appropriately sized (max 100px width)
- All form sections should stack vertically on mobile
- Maintain 2-column layout on desktop for better space usage

**Fix Plan:**
- Change grid from `grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
- Add `max-w-[100px]` class to CVV input field
- Update all form sections including shipping info and billing address
- Ensure consistent responsive behavior across all form sections

**Fix Status:** COMPLETED - All payment and shipping forms now use responsive single/double column layout
