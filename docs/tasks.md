## User Flow Specifications

### Primary Guest User Journey:
1. **Homepage** â†’ Browse featured products, social proof, call-to-actions
2. **Product Discovery** â†’ Filter by category (Men's, Women's, New Arrivals, Sale) or search
3. **Product Details** â†’ View specs, select size/color, add to cart, see recommendations
4. **Cart Review** â†’ Modify quantities, remove items, see totals, proceed to checkout
5. **Checkout Flow**:
   - Order summary with line items
   - Shipping information form
   - Upsell modal (recommended accessories/products)
   - Payment method selection (mock)
   - Order confirmation with tracking info
6. **Post-Purchase** â†’ Option to create account, order tracking, email confirmation

### Store State Requirements:
- Cart persistence across sessions
- Order management (create, store, retrieve orders)
- User account data (optional registration)
- Order history and tracking
- Email/contact information for guest orders

### Technical Implementation Notes:
- All payment processing should be mock/demo only (no real payment integration)
- Account creation should be optional and simplified
- Order data can be stored in localStorage for demo purposes
- Email notifications should be simulated/logged only
- Focus on UX flow rather than backend integration

## Phase 8: Checkout/Upsell Bug Fixes ðŸš¨

### Bug 1: Checkout Product Image Mismatch
**Current Issue:** Product image in checkout doesn't reflect selected color variant
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to product detail page (e.g., Elite Court Pro Basketball)
2. Select a specific color variant (e.g., Red/White)
3. Add to cart with selected color
4. Proceed to checkout
5. Observe that checkout shows main product image, not selected color variant

**Expected Behavior:** Checkout should display the specific color variant image that was selected
**Fix Plan:** 
- Update cart item storage to include `selectedColorImage` property
- Modify `addToCart` function in store to save the selected color's image URL
- Update checkout display to use `item.selectedColorImage` instead of `product.images[0]`
- Ensure cart page also reflects correct color variant images

### Bug 2: Generic Upsells with No Individual Selection âœ…
**Current Issue:** Upsell modal shows generic text-only accessories with no imagery and forces all-or-nothing selection
**COMPLETED** - Enhanced upsell modal with:
- Generated AI images for all accessories (shoe care kit, athletic socks, protector spray)
- Added accessories as proper products to catalog with full details
- Individual checkboxes for each upsell item  
- Quantity controls with +/- buttons
- Dynamic pricing calculation showing subtotals
- Visual selection states with highlighting
- Proper integration with cart system

### Bug 3: Upsell Items Not Added to Cart/Total âœ…
**Current Issue:** After selecting upsells and clicking "Add & Complete", items don't appear in final order total and user isn't returned to cart for review
**COMPLETED** - Fixed upsell checkout flow:
- Modified `handleUpsellComplete` to add selected upsells to cart
- Updated function to immediately create order with updated cart (including upsells)  
- Changed button text to "Add & Complete Order" for clarity
- User now goes directly to order confirmation with upsells included
- Eliminated unnecessary redirect to cart that forced users to checkout again
- Toast notification confirms order placement with accessories

### Bug 4: Missing Upsell Product Data Structure âœ…
**Current Issue:** Upsells are hardcoded with mock data instead of being proper products
**COMPLETED** - Fully integrated upsell products into main catalog:
- Added accessories as proper products in store with complete data (images, descriptions, pricing)
- Created dedicated `/accessories` page with full product browsing experience  
- Added Accessories navigation link to header (desktop and mobile)
- Updated routing to handle accessories as independent products
- Made accessories searchable through existing search functionality
- Added `getAccessories()` method to store for filtering
- Accessories can now be purchased independently outside checkout flow
- Maintained upsell functionality while making products standalone

## Phase 9: Post-Fix Checkout Issues ðŸš¨

### Bug 5: Missing Payment Method Input Fields
**Current Behavior:** When user selects credit card payment method, no input fields appear for card details
**Expected Behavior:** Should display comprehensive payment form with:
- Credit card number input field
- CVV/Security code field  
- Expiration date (month/year selectors)
- Cardholder name field
- Billing ZIP code input
- Option to use shipping address as billing address
- Address verification between shipping and billing

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Add items to cart and proceed to checkout
2. Complete shipping information step
3. Navigate to Payment Method step  
4. Select "Credit Card" radio button
5. Observe that no input fields appear below the selection

**Fix Plan:**
- Add conditional rendering in checkout payment section
- Create credit card form component with proper validation
- Include all standard payment fields (card number, CVV, expiry, name, billing address)
- Add toggle for "Same as shipping address" 
- Implement basic form validation (card number format, expiry date validation)
- Ensure form integrates with existing checkout flow
- Add visual feedback for form validation states

### Bug 6: Upsell Modal Missing Product Images
**Current Behavior:** Upsell modal displays without any product images despite recent implementation
**Expected Behavior:** Should show AI-generated product images for each accessory item

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Add items to cart and proceed through checkout
2. Complete shipping and payment steps
3. Click "Complete Order" to trigger upsell modal
4. Observe that accessory items show no images

**Fix Plan:**
- Debug image loading in upsell modal
- Verify AI-generated images are properly imported in store.ts
- Check that getUpsellProducts() function returns products with correct image paths
- Ensure image paths are correctly passed to modal component
- Verify image assets exist in src/assets directory
- Test image rendering in modal component
- Add fallback images if main images fail to load

### Bug 7: Order Confirmation Shows Wrong Product Image
**Current Behavior:** Order confirmation page displays main product image instead of selected color variant
**Expected Behavior:** Should display the specific color variant image that user selected and added to cart

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Navigate to product detail page (e.g., Velocity Runner)
2. Select a specific color variant (e.g., Black/White)  
3. Add to cart with selected color
4. Complete checkout process
5. View order confirmation page
6. Observe product image shows main product image, not selected color variant

**Fix Plan:**
- Update order creation to store selectedColorImage from cart items
- Modify Order interface to include selectedColorImage field for each item
- Update OrderConfirmation component to use item.selectedColorImage instead of product.image
- Ensure order storage persists the correct image URLs
- Test that cart â†’ checkout â†’ confirmation maintains image consistency
- Verify order history also shows correct color variant images
