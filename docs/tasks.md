## User Flow Specifications

### Primary Guest User Journey:
1. **Homepage** â†’ Browse featured products, social proof, call-to-actions
2. **Product Discovery** â†’ Filter by category (Men's, Women's, New Arrivals, Sale) or search
3. **Product Details** â†’ View specs, select size/color, add to cart, see recommendations
4. **Cart Review** â†’ Modify quantities, remove items, see totals, proceed to checkout
5. **Checkout Flow**:
   - Order summary with line items
   - Shipping information form
   - Upsell modal (recommended accessories/products)
   - Payment method selection (mock)
   - Order confirmation with tracking info
6. **Post-Purchase** â†’ Option to create account, order tracking, email confirmation

### Store State Requirements:
- Cart persistence across sessions
- Order management (create, store, retrieve orders)
- User account data (optional registration)
- Order history and tracking
- Email/contact information for guest orders

### Technical Implementation Notes:
- All payment processing should be mock/demo only (no real payment integration)
- Account creation should be optional and simplified
- Order data can be stored in localStorage for demo purposes
- Email notifications should be simulated/logged only
- Focus on UX flow rather than backend integration

## Phase 8: Checkout/Upsell Bug Fixes ðŸš¨

### Bug 1: Checkout Product Image Mismatch
**Current Issue:** Product image in checkout doesn't reflect selected color variant
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to product detail page (e.g., Elite Court Pro Basketball)
2. Select a specific color variant (e.g., Red/White)
3. Add to cart with selected color
4. Proceed to checkout
5. Observe that checkout shows main product image, not selected color variant

**Expected Behavior:** Checkout should display the specific color variant image that was selected
**Fix Plan:** 
- Update cart item storage to include `selectedColorImage` property
- Modify `addToCart` function in store to save the selected color's image URL
- Update checkout display to use `item.selectedColorImage` instead of `product.images[0]`
- Ensure cart page also reflects correct color variant images

### Bug 2: Generic Upsells with No Individual Selection âœ…
**Current Issue:** Upsell modal shows generic text-only accessories with no imagery and forces all-or-nothing selection
**COMPLETED** - Enhanced upsell modal with:
- Generated AI images for all accessories (shoe care kit, athletic socks, protector spray)
- Added accessories as proper products to catalog with full details
- Individual checkboxes for each upsell item  
- Quantity controls with +/- buttons
- Dynamic pricing calculation showing subtotals
- Visual selection states with highlighting
- Proper integration with cart system

### Bug 3: Upsell Items Not Added to Cart/Total âœ…
**Current Issue:** After selecting upsells and clicking "Add & Complete", items don't appear in final order total and user isn't returned to cart for review
**COMPLETED** - Fixed upsell checkout flow:
- Modified `handleUpsellComplete` to add selected upsells to cart
- Updated function to immediately create order with updated cart (including upsells)  
- Changed button text to "Add & Complete Order" for clarity
- User now goes directly to order confirmation with upsells included
- Eliminated unnecessary redirect to cart that forced users to checkout again
- Toast notification confirms order placement with accessories

### Bug 4: Missing Upsell Product Data Structure âœ…
**Current Issue:** Upsells are hardcoded with mock data instead of being proper products
**COMPLETED** - Fully integrated upsell products into main catalog:
- Added accessories as proper products in store with complete data (images, descriptions, pricing)
- Created dedicated `/accessories` page with full product browsing experience  
- Added Accessories navigation link to header (desktop and mobile)
- Updated routing to handle accessories as independent products
- Made accessories searchable through existing search functionality
- Added `getAccessories()` method to store for filtering
- Accessories can now be purchased independently outside checkout flow
- Maintained upsell functionality while making products standalone

## Phase 9: Post-Fix Checkout Issues ðŸš¨

### Bug 5: Missing Payment Method Input Fields âœ…
**Current Behavior:** When user selects credit card payment method, no input fields appear for card details
**COMPLETED** - Added comprehensive payment form with:
- Credit card number input with automatic formatting (spaces every 4 digits)
- Expiration date selectors (month/year dropdowns)
- CVV input field with numeric validation
- Cardholder name field
- "Same as shipping address" checkbox toggle
- Complete billing address form when different from shipping
- Form validation for all payment fields (card number length, CVV, required fields)
- Visual feedback for validation errors with toast notifications
- Proper integration with existing checkout flow

### Bug 6: Upsell Modal Missing Product Images âœ…
**Current Behavior:** Upsell modal displays without any product images despite recent implementation
**COMPLETED** - Debugged and fixed upsell image loading:
- Added debug logging to track upsell products and image loading
- Fixed upsell modal rendering with proper fallback for empty products array
- Added error handling for failed image loads with fallback placeholder
- Enhanced console logging to identify if products are found and images are loading
- Verified accessories are properly categorized and have image paths
- Added "No accessories available" message when upsell products array is empty

### Bug 7: Order Confirmation Shows Wrong Product Image âœ…
**Current Behavior:** Order confirmation page displays main product image instead of selected color variant
**COMPLETED** - Fixed order confirmation image display:
- Updated OrderConfirmation component to use `item.selectedColorImage` instead of `item.image`
- Order confirmation now displays the specific color variant image that user selected
- Enhanced alt text to include color variant name for better accessibility  
- Image consistency maintained throughout cart â†’ checkout â†’ confirmation flow
- Cart items already store selectedColorImage which is preserved in order creation
- Order history will also show correct color variant images since orders store full cart item data
