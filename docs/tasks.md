## User Flow Specifications

### Primary Guest User Journey:
1. **Homepage** â†’ Browse featured products, social proof, call-to-actions
2. **Product Discovery** â†’ Filter by category (Men's, Women's, New Arrivals, Sale) or search
3. **Product Details** â†’ View specs, select size/color, add to cart, see recommendations
4. **Cart Review** â†’ Modify quantities, remove items, see totals, proceed to checkout
5. **Checkout Flow**:
   - Order summary with line items
   - Shipping information form
   - Upsell modal (recommended accessories/products)
   - Payment method selection (mock)
   - Order confirmation with tracking info
6. **Post-Purchase** â†’ Option to create account, order tracking, email confirmation

### Store State Requirements:
- Cart persistence across sessions
- Order management (create, store, retrieve orders)
- User account data (optional registration)
- Order history and tracking
- Email/contact information for guest orders

### Technical Implementation Notes:
- All payment processing should be mock/demo only (no real payment integration)
- Account creation should be optional and simplified
- Order data can be stored in localStorage for demo purposes
- Email notifications should be simulated/logged only
- Focus on UX flow rather than backend integration

## Phase 8: Checkout/Upsell Bug Fixes ðŸš¨

### Bug 1: Checkout Product Image Mismatch
**Current Issue:** Product image in checkout doesn't reflect selected color variant
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to product detail page (e.g., Elite Court Pro Basketball)
2. Select a specific color variant (e.g., Red/White)
3. Add to cart with selected color
4. Proceed to checkout
5. Observe that checkout shows main product image, not selected color variant

**Expected Behavior:** Checkout should display the specific color variant image that was selected
**Fix Plan:** 
- Update cart item storage to include `selectedColorImage` property
- Modify `addToCart` function in store to save the selected color's image URL
- Update checkout display to use `item.selectedColorImage` instead of `product.images[0]`
- Ensure cart page also reflects correct color variant images

### Bug 2: Generic Upsells with No Individual Selection
**Current Issue:** Upsell modal shows generic text-only accessories with no imagery and forces all-or-nothing selection
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Complete checkout flow until upsell modal appears
2. Observe generic "Premium Shoe Care Kit" and "Athletic Socks" text-only items
3. Try to select only one item (not possible - only "Add & Complete" or "No Thanks")

**Expected Behavior:** 
- Upsells should have product images and visual appeal
- Users should be able to individually select/deselect each upsell item
- Each upsell should have quantity controls

**Fix Plan:**
- Generate AI images for upsell products (shoe care kit, athletic socks, etc.)
- Create proper upsell product data structure with images, descriptions, prices
- Redesign upsell modal with:
  - Individual checkboxes for each item
  - Product images and better descriptions
  - Quantity selectors for each item
  - Update total pricing dynamically as items are selected/deselected
- Add upsell products to main product catalog for consistency

### Bug 3: Upsell Items Not Added to Cart/Total
**Current Issue:** After selecting upsells and clicking "Add & Complete", items don't appear in final order total and user isn't returned to cart for review
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go through checkout flow
2. In upsell modal, click "Add & Complete"
3. Observe that:
   - User is not returned to cart to review updated totals
   - Upsell items don't appear in final order confirmation
   - Order total doesn't include upsell item prices

**Expected Behavior:** 
- Upsell items should be added to cart
- User should see updated cart totals including upsell items
- Final order should include all selected upsell items in confirmation

**Fix Plan:**
- Fix `handleUpsellComplete` function in Checkout component to actually add selected upsells to cart
- After adding upsells, redirect user back to cart page to review updated totals
- Ensure upsell items are properly included in order creation
- Update order confirmation to display all items including upsells
- Add proper cart state management for upsell additions

### Bug 4: Missing Upsell Product Data Structure
**Current Issue:** Upsells are hardcoded with mock data instead of being proper products
**Fix Plan:**
- Add upsell products to main product catalog in store
- Create product entries for:
  - Premium Shoe Care Kit (with proper images, description, pricing)
  - Athletic Socks 3-Pack (with color variants, sizing, images)
  - Other relevant accessories
- Update upsell logic to reference actual product IDs from catalog
- Ensure upsells can be purchased independently outside of checkout flow
